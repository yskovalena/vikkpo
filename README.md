Once upon the time there lived Masha. She lived on the farm and had a lot of animals. Animals of different species could be found everywhere 
both in the house and outdoors. Domestic animals, namely cats and dogs were allowed to enter the house. Farm animals, such as cows, sheep and ducks were not permitted to come in.
Masha liked taking care of all animals that lived on the farm but primarily she adored her pets 
(domestic animals). She had two dogs, three cats, one parrot and some insects. Her dad and mom didn’t approve of her keeping 
insects as pets because they were afraid of her life. The spider was her favorite insect and she played with it most of her time. 
It’s well-known that spiders may bite, that’s why parents thought it to be able to injure their daughter. Nevertheless, a girl was very brave and was scared of 
nothing because she knew for sure that her spider wasn’t poisonous, it was domesticated.
Apart from domestic animals, farm animals and insects there were reptiles on her farm as well. It were chameleons, lizards and snakes. 
Masha also liked reptiles but was cautious about them because she was extremely smart and was aware of the grave danger which snakes represented.
